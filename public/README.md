# SNoogle 📬

SNoogle is a lightweight, modern web app built with React that mimics the core feel of Gmail — but with a twist.  
It includes two main apps: **SNAil** (Mail) and **SNeep** (Notes), designed and built as part of a fullstack project by **Shaham** and **Noga** during our studies at **Coding Academy**.

> Designed to feel clean, interactive, and familiar — with subtle touches of fun.

### 🗒️ SNeep – Notes App (Noga's part)

SNeep is a simple yet flexible note-taking tool that allows users to:

- **Add different types of notes**
  - Text notes
  - Todo lists
  - Image-based notes

- **Organize your ideas** in a visual layout
- **Quickly create and view notes** in a grid interface
- **Enjoy a clean, minimal experience** suitable for brainstorming and light productivity

> This part of the app was led by **Noga**, and while Shaham focused on the mail system, both apps are part of the same unified experience.
